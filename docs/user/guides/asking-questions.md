# How to Ask Effective Questions

Get better answers by asking better questions!

## The Basics

### Good Question Structure

**Format:**
```
[Question word] + [Specific topic] + [Context/Constraint]
```

**Examples:**
- "What are the **three main risks** mentioned in **section 5**?"
- "How does **the author define** success **in chapter 2**?"
- "**Compare** the Q3 results **between 2023 and 2024**"

### Question Types

#### 1. Factual Questions
**Goal:** Get specific facts
```
✅ "What was the revenue in Q3 2024?"
✅ "Who is the CEO of the company?"
✅ "When was the product launched?"
```

#### 2. Explanatory Questions
**Goal:** Understand concepts
```
✅ "How does the machine learning algorithm work?"
✅ "Why did the company change strategy?"
✅ "Explain the benefits of approach X"
```

#### 3. Analytical Questions
**Goal:** Deep insights
```
✅ "What are the implications of these findings?"
✅ "How does this compare to industry standards?"
✅ "What patterns emerge from the data?"
```

#### 4. Summarization
**Goal:** Overview
```
✅ "Summarize the key points of chapter 3"
✅ "What are the main conclusions?"
✅ "Give me the executive summary"
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Be Specific

**❌ Vague:**
- "Tell me about the company"
- "What does it say?"
- "Explain the data"

**✅ Specific:**
- "What were the company's Q3 2024 earnings?"
- "What does the document say about risk management?"
- "Explain the trends shown in Figure 3"

### 2. Provide Context

**❌ No context:**
- "What's the number?"
- "Who said that?"
- "When did it happen?"

**✅ With context:**
- "What was the revenue growth rate in Q3?"
- "Who made the statement about AI in chapter 5?"
- "When was the product recall mentioned in the report?"

### 3. Break Down Complex Questions

**❌ Too complex:**
"What are the financial implications of the strategic pivot announced in Q2 considering the competitive landscape and regulatory changes?"

**✅ Break into steps:**
1. "What strategic pivot was announced in Q2?"
2. "What were the financial implications?"
3. "How did the competitive landscape affect this?"
4. "What regulatory changes impacted the decision?"

### 4. Use Follow-up Questions

**First question:**
"What is the company's growth strategy?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "Can you elaborate on the international expansion?"
- "What metrics are they using to measure success?"
- "What are the biggest challenges mentioned?"
- "How does this compare to last year's strategy?"

## Search Modes

Choose the right mode for your question:

### 🔄 Hybrid (Default - Recommended)

**Best for:** Most questions

Combines semantic understanding + keyword matching.

**Use when:**
- General questions
- Not sure which mode to use
- Want comprehensive results

**Example:**
"What are the main benefits of the new product?"

### 🧠 Semantic Search

**Best for:** Conceptual questions

Understands meaning and context.

**Use when:**
- Asking about concepts
- Synonyms and related terms
- Questions phrased differently than document

**Example:**
"How does this improve user experience?"
(Matches: "enhances usability", "better for customers", etc.)

### 🔍 Keyword Search

**Best for:** Exact matching

Finds exact words and phrases.

**Use when:**
- Looking for specific terms
- Technical jargon
- Names, dates, numbers
- Acronyms

**Example:**
"Find mentions of 'GDPR compliance'"

## Query Optimization

### Length Matters

**Too short:** "AI"
- Not enough context

**Too long:** "I'm wondering if you could please tell me everything the document says about artificial intelligence and machine learning and how they're being used in the company's products and what the future roadmap looks like..."
- Too complex, confusing

**Just right:** "What are the company's AI initiatives mentioned in the roadmap?"
- Clear, specific, focused

### Use Quotes for Exact Phrases
```
"machine learning algorithm"  → Exact phrase
quarterly earnings → Individual words
```

### Specify Sections

If you know where information is:
```
"What does section 3 say about pricing?"
"Summarize chapter 5"
"Find the table in page 10"
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: What/Who/When/Where/Why/How
```
What is [topic]?
Who is responsible for [task]?
When did [event] occur?
Where is [location] mentioned?
Why did [action] happen?
How does [process] work?
```

### Pattern 2: Compare/Contrast
```
Compare X and Y
What's the difference between X and Y?
How does X contrast with Y?
```

### Pattern 3: List/Enumerate
```
List all [items]
What are the [number] main [things]?
Enumerate the steps to [process]
```

### Pattern 4: Summarize/Explain
```
Summarize [topic/section]
Explain [concept] in simple terms
Give me an overview of [topic]
```

## Examples by Document Type

### Research Papers
```
✅ "What is the main hypothesis?"
✅ "What methodology was used?"
✅ "What were the key findings in section 4?"
✅ "How does this compare to Smith et al. (2023)?"
```

### Business Documents
```
✅ "What was the Q3 revenue?"

✅ "Show me an example of API usage"
✅ "What error codes are documented?"
```

### Legal Documents
```
✅ "What are the termination clauses?"
✅ "What is the liability limit?"
✅ "When does the contract expire?"
✅ "What are the payment terms?"
```
