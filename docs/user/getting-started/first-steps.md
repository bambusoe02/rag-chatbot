- Upload executables or suspicious files
- Ask questions about unuploaded documents
- Expect real-time information (uses your docs only)
- Share sensitive data on cloud version
- Forget to cite sources when using answers

## Getting Better Results

### Make Questions More Specific

**❌ Vague:** "Tell me about the document"
**✅ Specific:** "What are the three main conclusions in section 4?"

**❌ Too broad:** "What does it say about AI?"
**✅ Focused:** "According to the document, what are the limitations of current AI systems?"

### Provide Context

**❌ No context:** "What's the number?"
**✅ With context:** "What was the revenue growth percentage in Q3 2024?"

### Ask Follow-up Questions

After first answer, dig deeper:
1. "Can you elaborate on that?"
2. "What evidence supports this?"
3. "Are there any exceptions?"
4. "How does this relate to X?"

## Troubleshooting

### "No documents found"
→ Upload documents first before asking

### "Processing..." takes too long
→ Large files take 30-60 seconds, wait patiently

### Answer seems wrong
→ Try different search mode or rephrase question
